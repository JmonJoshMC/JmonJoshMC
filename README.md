# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a minecraft modder and aspiring content creator.

## My current projects are:
 - [Jmons Extended Mechanics](https://github.com/JmonJoshMC/JmonExtendedMechanics)
   - I am considering making a youtube survival series with this mod (to showcase the mod in a fun, engaging way)
   - I also make this mod with skyblock parity in mind
   - One day, I would like to make compatability with other mods once I figure out how to do that...
- MineChem Remastered [WIP]:
   - A reimagined take on MineChem for modern minecraft
       - Considering adding realistic ore veins/gas pockets based on their universal abundance values IRL, without removing vanilla worldgen (I wouldn't replace air with oxygen/hydrogen, etc)
       - Adding a Chemistry Table, for converting elements into vanilla blocks (for example, Si + O2 = Glass Block)
## Future Plans
 - I want to one day make a mod that overhauls vanilla minecraft structures to be gigantic (like, a jungle temple being 400x400 blocks!)
   - Maybe at some point, I could collaborate with Big Globe or JJThunder to make the worldgen match the size of the structures
   - This was inspired from When Dungeons Arise, which does something similar, except not with vanilla structures
   - I am running into issues with structure size, since minecraft kinda doesn't load with the mod, so I'm not sure how to optimize this...
 - April fools updates: so many ideas for this :)
